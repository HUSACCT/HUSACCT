<h1>Action Log</h1>
<p>The action log will show primary actions you've taken in HUSACCT. Say for example you've analysed a project. After analysing you'll see a message appear in the Action Log showing you the time you've analysed. The same goes for defining or validating. It is disabled by default and can be enabled in Tools -> Options -> General.<br />
