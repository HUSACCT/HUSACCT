<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>When using HUSACCT it is important to know in which order the functionalities can be used. HUSACCT differentiates between several states:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NONE</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">No workspace has been created or opened</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">OPENED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">A new workspace has been created or opened</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEFINED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">An logical architecture has been defined</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">APPSET</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">Application details have been set</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRE_ANALYSED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">An application has been pre-analysed (required for progress bar)</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANALYSED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">An application has been analysed</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAPPED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">An analysed application has been mapped to the logical architecture</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">VALIDATED</span><br />
		<span style="font-style: italic;">A mapped application has been validated</span>
	</li>
	
</ul>
<p>The state you&rsquo;re in defines the function you can use. For example, it is not possible to map an architecture to a physical application if the application has not yet been analysed.</p>
