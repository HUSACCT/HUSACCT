	<h3><#1 MODULE HIERARCHY</h3>
	This area shows the logical defined architecture. 
	Here you can see the defined modules. It also allows you to select modules for the rest of the application. 
	You can select a module by simply clicking on it.
	<h3>#2 SELECTED MODULE PROPERTIES</h3>
	This area shows the properties of the currently selected module. You can change the module name and/or description.
	<h3>#3 SELECTED MODULE SOFTWARE UNITS</h3>
	This area shows the software units that are currently mapped to the selected module. The buttons are only enabled if a module is selected.
	<h3>#4 SELECTED MODULE RULES</h3>
	This area shows the rules that are currently defined for the selected module. The buttons are only enabled if a module is selected.
	<h3>#5 TOOLBAR</h3>
	The toolbar has some nifty features that are not necessary to define the architecture, but can make it a lot easier or better. 
	The first button is the warnings button, when clicking it, it will show a dialog with all the warnings that your architecture has.
	When clicking on the second button, the ‘View in Browser’-button, you get a HTML-report/overview with all modules, applied rules
	and software units that you defined. Next to these buttons are the undo and redo buttons. Made a mistake? Undo it!
	Undid something you needed? Redo!
