DefineHelpDialogIntroductionText <h2>Getting started with Defining the Architecture </h2><br/><p>Hello there! Welcome to this quick tutorial how to get started with the Defining an Architecture. There are three steps to define the architecture: </p>
DefineHelpDialogContentText <h3>Identify modules:</h3> The first step is to <b>'Identify the modules'</b>, this can be done on the left side of the screen, under the title 'Module hierarchy'.Here you can create new types of modules, like 'Subsystem', 'Layer', 'Component' or 'External Library'. <br/><h3>Assign software units</h3>After you identified all your modules, you can map the modules to the actual code. If you head over to <b>'Assigned Software Units '</b>, you can use the add button to select packages and assign them to the software unit. <br/><h3>Create rules for modules</h3>After you assigned packages to their module, you can add rules for your modules. Rules that are required for the type of module are already added automatically, but you can add more rules.
RuleNotConformConvention This rule cannot be added, because it is not conform the convention.
IncorrectToModuleFacadeConvExc Illegal module selected: The exception module has to match with the main rule module, or one of its submodules.
