	<h1>Terminology</h1>
	<p>The most used terminology will be explained in this paragraph.</p>
	<br />
	<span class="keyword">History points</span>
	<p>When HUSACCT periodically is used, there might be the need of an
		overview of violations in the past. One point of the past is a history
		point.</p>
	<br />
	<span class="keyword">Rule types and violation types</span>
	<p>
		A rule is of a specific type <span class="keyword">(rule type)</span>. A rule can be applied
		on ore more modules (depending on the rule type). A violation type is
		the type of the violation that can occur during the validation
		process. It is possible to filter on violation types in the define
		process (see for more information the documentation of the define
		component).
	</p>
	<br />
	<span class="keyword">Exception rules</span>
	<p>Some rule types can have exception rules which are mostly
		counterparts of the rule type. For example the exception rule of rule
		type ‘Is Not Allowed To Use’ is ‘Is Allowed To Use’.</p>
	<br />
	<span class="keyword">Violation</span>
	<p>When a rule is exceeded during validation process, a violation
		is occurred.</p>
	<br />
	<span class="keyword">Severity</span>
	<p>Each rule and violation type have their own severity. If a rule
		has a lower severity than a violation type (or vice versa), always the
		highest severity will be taken as the severity.</p>
