	<h1>Browse violations</h1>
	<p>
		After defining the logical architecture, mapping scanned source
		code to the logical architecture and defining rules in the logical
		architecture the possibility to check if the defined architecture has
		violations is available.</p>
	<p>
		This can be done in the <span class="keyword">browse violations
		screen</span> (figure 1). The goal of this screen is to validate the project
		and to see if any violations have occurred. Additional features are:
	<ul>
		<li>sorting;</li>
		<li>filtering;</li>
		<li>creating a history point.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>The screen can be opened through “menu -> Validate -> Validate
		now” or by pressing the “validate now” icon (<img src="RESOURCE.GET(/validate/validate.png)">) in the toolbar
	</p>
	<p id="important-notice">Note: When storing the workspace the violations won’t be stored.
							 The violation history points are experimental and unwanted behavior can occur.
	</p>

	<p>Explanation of the components of figure 1:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When this button is pressed, the system will check if there are violations on the defined rules.</li>
		<li>When this button is pressed, the last known violations will be shown to the user. The violations will be shown in area 7.</li>
		<li>When this button is pressed, the system creates a history point of the last known violations. When the violations are saved the system will disable the button. 
			For saving the violations you need to add a description of the violations.
		</li>
		<li>This table contains all the created/available history points. After clicking on a row, the system will show the violations that are saved in that point.
			The violations will be shown in area 7.
		</li>
		<li>When this button is pressed, the system will remove the selected history point in area 4.</li>
		<li>This panel shows information about the amount of violations. It shows the total violations, the violations shown this moment and the amount of violations per severity.</li>
		<li>This table shows all the violations. The violations can be sorted by clicking on the headers, e.g. ‘From’.
			If you want more information about a violation select the row of the specific violation.
			The information will be shown in area 8.
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>From: the ‘from’ path from which the dependency/violation starts. Contains the physical path of the source file were the violations occurs;</li>
			<li>To: the ‘to’ path were the dependency/violations ends. Contains the physical path of the source file which is responsible for the violation;</li>
			<li>Rule: the name of the defined rule;</li>
			<li>Type: the dependency type of the violation;</li>
			<li>Direct/Indirect: the kind of dependency type of the violation. Direct of indirect;</li>
			<li>Severity: the severity of the violation.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>This panel shows information about the selected of the selection violation in area 7.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Line number: the line number in the source code where this violation occurs;</li>
			<li>Logical module from: the name of the logical module where the physical class of the ‘Source’ column of area 7 is mapped into;</li>
			<li>Logical module to: the name of the logical module where the physical class of the ‘Target’ column of area 7 is mapped into;</li>
			<li>Message: a textual description of the defined rule.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>With this button the code viewer can be used to see the exact piece of code which is responsible for the violation. (see the code viewer chapter)</li>
		<li>With this checkbox the filter can be turned on or off.</li>
		<li>When this button is pressed it will open the Filter dialog (see the filter dialog chapter).</li>
		<li>This is an on screen filter to switch between all kinds of dependencies, only direct dependencies or only indirect dependencies.
		 	These only work when the checkbox of area 9 is selected.
		 </li>
	</ol>
