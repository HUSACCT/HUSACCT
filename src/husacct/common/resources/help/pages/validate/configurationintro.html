	<h1>Configuration</h1>
	<p>
		The validate component provides also the possibility to configure the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Severities; adding new severities and change existing severities.</li>
			<li>Severities; adding new severities and change existing severities.</li>
			<li>Severity per violation type; change the severity for a violation type.</li>
			<li>Active violation types; which violation types should be enabled by default in the filter when adding new rules in the define component. (For more information about filtering in rule types see the manual of the define component.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The changes that are made are not directly reflected in the GUI. For example when severities are changed in the configuration, there must be revalidated to reflect the changes that are made in the configuration.
