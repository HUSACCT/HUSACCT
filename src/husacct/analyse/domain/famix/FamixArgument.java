/**
 * The Class Argument. An Argument represents the passing of an argument when
 * invoking a BehaviouralEntity. What exactly constitutes such a definition is a
 * language dependent issue. The model distinguishes between two kind of
 * arguments, an ExpressionArgument or an AccessArgument. The former means that
 * some complex expression is passed, in that case the contents of the
 * expression is not further specified. The latter means that a reference to a
 * StructuralEntity is passed, thus involving an Access to the corresponding
 * structural entity, hence a reference to the corresponding Access is stored
 * within the AccessArgument. Both ExpressionArgument and AccessArgument are
 * concrete classes inheriting from Argument. Argument is an abstract class
 * inheriting from Object. Besides inherited attributes, Argument has the
 * following attributes:
