<h1>Supported rules</h1>
<p>
	The following rules are provided in the HUSACCT applications and
	can be validated. For each rule, the possible exceptions and the
	possible violation types will be given.
</p>
<br />
<h2>Property rule types</h2>
<span class="ruletype">Interface convention</span>
<br />
<p>
	Each class in the specified module must implement the specified
	interface. An exception on this rule will exclude certain classes or
	packages from this rule.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>
<br />
<p>
	Each class in the specified module must only communicate to
	classes outside the module via the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<br />
<span class=ruletype>SuperClassInheritance convention</span>
<br />
<p>
	Each class in the specified module must extend the specified
	class. An exception on this rule will exclude certain classes or
	packages from this rule.</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Naming convention</span>
<br />
<p>
	All the classes and/or packages in the specified module must meet to
	the specified <span class="keyword">Regular Expression</span> (see table 1). The <span class="keyword">regular
	expressions</span> are case-sensitive. An exception on this rule will
	exclude certain classes or packages from this rule.

<p class="caption">Table 1<span class="caption-explanation">&nbsp;overview of possible regexes for the naming convention rule type</span></p>
<br />
<span>The first regex enforces that a class/package must contain the word "Friends" in the name.</span>
<br />
<span>The second regex enforces that a class/package must contain the word "Friends anywhere in the name.</span>
<br />
<span>The third regex enforces that a class/package must end with the word "Account".</span>
<br /> 
<span>The fourth regex enforces that all the classes and/or packages must start with the word "DAO".</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Visibilty convention</span>
<br />
<p>
	All the classes and/or packages in the specified module must have the specified visibility or lower.
	The possible exceptions are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>possibility to exclude classes/packages;</li>
	<li>add another visibility convention for classes/packages that were specified in the main rule.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Relation rule types</h2>
<span class="ruletype">Is allowed to use</span>
<br />
<p>
	This rule can only be defined as exception rule. All the classes/packages between two logical modules are allowed to have a dependency.
	This is normally the case, so it can only be defined as an exception rule.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Is not allowed to use</span>
<br />
<p>
	This rule can only be defined as exception rule. All the classes/packages between two logical modules are allowed to have a dependency.
	This is normally the case, so it can only be defined as an exception rule.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Is only allowed to use</span>
<br />
<p>
	One defined logical module is only allowed to have dependencies with another defined logical module. 
	The possible exception is to define is a "is allowed to use" rule.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Is only module allowed to use</span>
<br />
<p>
	Of all defined logical modules, only one logical module may have dependencies with another specified logical module.
	There are no possible exception rules.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Must use</span>
<br />
<p>
	At least one class/package between two logical modules must have a dependency with each other.
	The possible exception is to define a "is allowed to use" or a "is not allowed to use" rule.
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Is not allowed to make back-call</span>
<br />
<p>
	This rule can only be applied on modules of type layer (see for more information the manual of the define component). A layer may not have dependency with layers that are defined with a higher hierarchal level then the layer on which the rule is applied to.
	The possible exception is to define a "is allowed to use" rule.  
</p>
<br />
<span class="ruletype">Is not allowed to make skip-call</span>
<br />
<p>
	This rule can only be applied on modules of type layer (see for more information the manual of the define component). A layer may not have dependency with layers that are defined with a lower hierarchal level then the layer on which the rule is applied to, except for the layer that is directly under the layer on which the rule is applied to.
	The possible exception is to define a "is allowed to use" rule.
