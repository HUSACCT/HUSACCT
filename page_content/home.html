<h1>HUSACCT Home</h1>
<p>HUSACCT provides support for software architecture reconstruction (SAR) and software architecture compliance checking (SACC) with respect to the modular architecture of Java and C# systems.<br>
SACC functionality monitors the conformance of the implemented architecture (in the source code) to the intended software architecture (in the design).<br>
Basic SAR functionality helps to get an understanding of the implemented architecture, e.g. by browsing or visualizing the software units (packages, 
namespaces, classes) with their dependencies. <br>
More advanced SAR functionality aids the reconstruction of the intended architecture in terms 
of logical modules such as layers, components and subsystems.
<br> 
<br>
The prominent feature of HUSACCT is the support of semantically rich modular architectures, which are composed of modules of different types (like 
subsystems, layers , components and external systems) and rules of different types. To perform an SACC, first an intended software architecture has 
to be defined which describes the modules and their types, the rules (constraints), and the assignment of implemented software units to the modules. 
Next, HUSACCT checks the compliance to the defined rules, based on static analysis of the source code, and it reports violations to the rules.
