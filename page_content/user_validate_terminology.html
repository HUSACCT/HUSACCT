<h1>Terminology</h1>
<p>The most used terminology will be explained in this paragraph.</p>
<span class="keyword">History points</span>
<p>When HUSACCT periodically is used, there might be the need of an
	overview of violations in the past. One point of the past is a history
	point.</p>
<span class="keyword">Rule types and violation types</span>
<p>
	A rule is of a specific type <span class="keyword">(rule type)</span>. A rule can be applied
	on ore more modules (depending on the rule type). A violation type is
	the type of the violation that can occur during the validation
	process. It is possible to filter on violation types in the define
	process (see for more information the documentation of the define
	component).
</p>
<span class="keyword">Exception rules</span>
<p>Some rule types can have exception rules which are mostly
	counterparts of the rule type. For example the exception rule of rule
	type "Is Not Allowed To Use" is "Is Allowed To Use".</p>
<span class="keyword">Violation</span>
<p>When a rule is exceeded during validation process, a violation
	is occurred.</p>
<span class="keyword">Severity</span>
<p>Each rule and violation type have their own severity. If a rule
	has a lower severity than a violation type (or vice versa), always the
	highest severity will be taken as the severity.</p>
